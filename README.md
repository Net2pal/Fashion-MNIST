# Fashion-MNIST
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

The new dataset contains images of various clothing items - such as shirts, shoes, coats and other fashion items.

I will use 60,000 images to train the network and 10,000 images to evaluate how accurately the network learned to classify images. We can access the Fashion MNIST directly from TensorFlow, just import and load the data.
